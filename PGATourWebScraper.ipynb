    "# PGATour.com Web Scraper\n",
    "### Updated: 1/24/2024 to handle the new website from late 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the Site:\n",
    "The PGA Tour website had recently gone through an update in its workings as I realized upon taking on this project. To complete the scraping as I had desired, common scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium wouldn't work as far as I was aware. Because of this, this notebook follows a journey in learning about tables built on websites through JavaScript and scraping the data utlizing this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site utilizes GraphQL for their databases, so accessing the Network tab of Google Chrome gave insight into a couple key observations regarding its workings. First, each stat has a respective \"stat_id\", a number indicating which stat is being reported in the table. Also, corresponding to the drop down menus accessible to the user, year and tournament can be selected. In this way, the user can indicate which year, and through which tournament they want to observe the leaderboard for any given statistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my application of this data, I wanted to find the yearly leaderboard at the end of each competitive season, i.e. after the TOUR Championship. This notebook aims to create an SQL database in which for each year, each PGA pro has a row corresponding to the values of each of their statistics that given year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Procedure:\n",
    "1. Import relevant libraries\n",
    "2. Define a method to obtain all \"Stat IDs\" from https://www.pgatour.com/stats\n",
    "3. Define a method to obtain a dataframe of all players on tour and their specific stat given a Stat ID and Year\n",
    "4. Merge dataframes into one dataframe\n",
    "5. Convert merged dataframe to SQL database for use in subsequent notebooks"

    "This notebook tracks my progress--what I would consider to be leaps and bounds--in my knowledge of the workings of websites utilizing JavaScript and GraphQL to generate tables. Not only did this project allow me to reach out of my comfort zone in learning a new webscraping technique, but it gave me great practice with merging and concatenating various data frames utilizing the Pandas library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there is much more to be done with this notebook. For starters, one limitation that I have noticed was from 2004-2012, the aforementioned drop down doesn't have the TOUR championship as the last championship, so another condition might need to be checked. Luckly, these years are outside the scope of my data project in which I'll be using this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With these limitations in mind, this notebook perfectly sets up further notebooks in this repository where I analyze this data further determining interesting patterns and trends in the world of professional golf with which I hope to improve my own amateur game."
