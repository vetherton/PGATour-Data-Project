# PGATour-Data-Project

## About

This repository contains my PGATour Data Analysis Project. After completing various courses in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered by Coursera and IBM, I felt I had the knowledge to complete a small project about something I am quite passionate about: the world of golf. I wanted to find out what statistics made professional golfers so great so that I could hone in on these aspects to possibly improve my amateur game. 

## What I Did

First, in looking at the PGATour.com website, I found a comprehensive list of statistics pages dating back to the 2004 season. I knew that the tables on the web pages were built dynamically, so I was given the chance to learn about GraphQL, an API for data and statistics on web pages. I conducted an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the 2022-23 season using downloadable .csv files from the website. The EDA is available in the PGATourEDA_2022-2023.ipynb notebook, which can be downloaded and executed along with the 2022-2023 folder.

I quickly found this to be cumbersome, especially for analyses of multiple years. So, I created a web scraper to glean statistics information from the past 10 years. This procedure is outlined in the PGATourWebScraper.ipynb notebook. To use this scraper, simply download the notebook and create a .env file in the same directory with your API key. The scraper allows users to input specific stats they want to see in the data frame. I will soon update it to reflect the statistics used in my second EDA, focusing on data from 2013-2023.

## In the Future

Looking ahead, my plans include publishing an EDA that analyzes data spanning 2013 to 2023, aiming to uncover more long-term trends in the PGA Tour. Additionally, I am considering exploring the statistics page on the LIVGolf websiteâ€”a recently controversial alternative to the PGA Tour that many tour players are moving to.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!
